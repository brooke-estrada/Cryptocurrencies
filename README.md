## Cryptocurrencies

### Background: 
An accounting firm asked our team to create a report that includes what cryptocurrencies are on the trading market and how they could be grouped to create a classification system for this new investment.

#### Analysis: 
 Since there is no known output, we decided to use unsupervised learning. We conducted a PCA analysis and a Kmeans clustering model. We created a 3D-Scatter plot using PCA data and the cluster. We also created an interactive table to look at the individual crypto coins and their trade value. We then shared the data visualizations and our findings with the board.
